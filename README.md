# Neighbourhood
This thesis explores the design and development of a neighborhood lending app using the Design Thinking methodology. 
The goal is to create a user-friendly digital platform that facilitates borrowing between neighbors at no cost. 
Through research, market analysis, user personas, wireframes, prototyping, and usability testing, 
we aim to design an intuitive solution that encourages resource sharing and sustainability. 
This study provides insights into UX design principles, user behavior, and the impact of community-based sharing platforms.
